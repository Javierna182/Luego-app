# Luego APP: Donâ€™t forget your creative ideas! 

Luego is a personal app for creative minds who wants to keep track of their process and progress of creative projects; it is not a social media app. The objective of this application is to help log ongoing creative ideas in a single, organized space. Additionally, this will help keep track of the status of projects and final work.

This app is made to help people store, develop and complete their projects.
